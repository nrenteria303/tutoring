            <p>Too often in education, math comprehension is seen one of two ways: you either get it, or you don't. So when a student feels like they don't get math, it creates a vicious circle of stress and struggle on their homework and tests.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <h1 class="section-heading">Are you looking for a tutor with experience?</h1>
          <div class="section-text">
            <p>With nearly ten years of tutoring experience with students from kindergarten through college, I know how to help you or your student tackle the ins and outs of nearly any math class.</p>

            <p>I've worked in public high schools and private tutoring centers. I've helped students with learning disabilities and successful students who just needed someone to explain things a different way.</p>
            <p>Wherever your student falls on the math comprehension spectrum, I can help them improve their confidence and their grades!</p>

          <h1 class="section-heading">Need flexibility too?</h1>
          <div class="section-text">
            <p>Students from elementary school through college tend to stay busy. Club activity, sports, jobs and vacations can all take time away from homework and studying, so a tutor with a flexible schedule of their own is a must.</p>
            <img class="section-img-left" src="images/calendar.jpg" alt="A calendar and other scheduling items" title="A calendar, clock, and other scheduling items">
            <p>Tutoring is the top priority on my calendar. Whether it's a study session for an upcoming test or regular weekly homework help, I want to work around your busy schedule.</p>
            <p>To top it all off, I can even come to your home or any nearby library or cafe to make it the easiest, most convenient tutoring experience possible!</p>
