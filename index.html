              <p>Too often in education, math comprehension is seen one of two ways: you either get it, or you don't. So when a student feels like they don't get math, it creates a vicious circle of stress and struggle on their homework and tests.</p>
              <p>For years I've been passionate about disproving this math myth, helping students who think they <em>just can't get math</em> exceed their expectations and conquer what once seemed forever out of reach.</p>

              <p>With nearly ten years of <a href="#">tutoring experience</a> with students from kindergarten through college, I know how to help you or your student tackle the ins and outs of nearly any math class.</p>
              <p>I've worked in public high schools and private tutoring centers. I've helped students with learning disabilities and successful students who just needed someone to explain things a different way.</p>
              <p>Wherever your student falls on the math comprehension spectrum, I can help them improve their confidence and their grades! Take a look at <a href="./about.html">my story</a> and see how I can help your student.</p>

              <p>Students from elementary school through college tend to stay busy. Club activity, sports, jobs and vacations can all take time away from homework and studying, so a tutor with a flexible schedule of their own is a must.</p>
              <p>Tutoring is the top priority on my calendar. Whether it's a study session for an upcoming test or regular weekly homework help, I want to work around your busy schedule. <a href="./contact.html">Call or email</a> me today to see when I can work with your student!</p>

              <p>Let's not forget how busy parents get. I want to save you the hassle of driving home from work to pick up your student, only to drive back to a tutor on the other side of town.</p> 
              <P>I can come to your home or any nearby library or cafe to make it the easiest, most convenient tutoring experience possible. <a href="./contact.html">Call or email me</a> to set up your session today!</p>
